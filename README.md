TerminalDirectoryTraverser
==========================
**TerminalDirectoryTraverser** is a small bash script to easily traverse folders through Terminal.


# How-to:
Place it in your /bin folder that contains all your scripts. In order to cd to another folder through a subshell, you need to source the script. This is done by placing a dot '.' before calling folders; or even writing 'source'. 
For example: 
  ```
  $ . folders
  ```
